# Docker Build Error: Missing or Incorrect Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a common error when building Docker images: missing or incorrectly specified dependencies. The original `Dockerfile` attempts to install Python and its dependencies, but it omits crucial steps.  The solution, `Dockerfile.fixed`, addresses this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Try building the original Dockerfile: `docker build -t myapp .`
3. You will encounter an error.
4. Then build the fixed Dockerfile: `docker build -t myapp-fixed -f Dockerfile.fixed .`
5. The build will complete successfully.

## Root Cause

The original `Dockerfile` fails because it doesn't account for the need to install `apt-transport-https` before using `apt-get update` in the case that it's missing from the base image, and also because it does not specify the exact version of Python needed. This can cause build failures and inconsistent behavior across different environments.

## Solution

The fixed `Dockerfile` addresses these problems. It ensures that all necessary packages are installed. It also adds a more robust way of handling Python installation.
